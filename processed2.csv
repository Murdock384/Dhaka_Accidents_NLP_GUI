Five others injured from the accident are currently being treated at the Tangail General Hospital.
Local police couldn’t immediately identify all of the three deceased women.
But a relative of the family in Chattogram confirmed that the three women were Mabia,15, her mother Farida Begum, 30, and her aunt Ferdousi Begum, 34 all hailing from Chattogram’s Freeport area under EPZ police station.
Saifur Rahman, a close relative of the three confirmed their identities to UNB’s Chattogram correspondent.
“They left for Sirajganj Cancer Hospital by an ambulance from Chattogram around 12 am for  cancer patient Farida Begum’s scheduled chemotherapy session”, he said.
However, all the victims boarded the northern district-bound ambulance supposedly in the absence of any public transport due to the Covid-induced stricter lockdown, said Bangabandhu-Bridge East police station’s Sub-Inspector Nazmul earlier to UNB’s Tangail correspondent.
The accident occurred around 7.30am when the fish laden truck crashed into the ambulance that was coming from the opposite direction on the east side of Bangabandhu bridge in the Hatia area, police said.
The impact of the collision was such that three occupants of the ambulance including the driver died on the spot. The seven other injured occupants were rushed to Tangail General Hospital, where two of them were declared dead on arrival.
A probe has been ordered into the accident, a police official said.
Road accidents in Bangladesh
Road accidents are common in Bangladesh and have been a major cause of deaths.
During the last Eid-ul-Fitr holiday rush, road accidents claimed 323 lives in just 15 days, said Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Shamiti, a human rights body.
Besides, 513 people, including 63 children, were killed and 598 injured in 409 road accidents across the country in March, said the Road Safety Foundation on April 5.
According to the NGO, 147 lives were lost in 138 motorcycle accidents, which is 28.65% of the total deaths.
In a report released in February 2020, the World Bank pointed out that Bangladesh needs to invest an estimated $7.8 billion over the next decade to halve its road crash fatalities.
The report attributed the high death rate on Bangladesh’s roads to lack of investments in systemic, targeted, and sustained road safety programmes.>";<409>;<D>;<Saturday>;<in Kalihati>;<Kalihati>;<Dhaka>;<Tangail>;<Kalihati>;<road>;<Bangladesh>;<road>;<5>;<5>;<collision>;<Truck>;<Motorcycle>;<Ambulance>;<NA>;<(15, 30)>;<20210703 12:01>

Road accidents in Bangladesh
Road accidents are common in Bangladesh and have been a major cause of deaths.
During the last Eid-ul-Fitr holiday rush, road accidents claimed 323 lives in just 15 days, according to Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Shamiti, a human rights body.
Besides, 513 people, including 63 children, were killed and 598 injured in 409 road accidents across the country in March, the Road Safety Foundation said on April 5.
According to the NGO, 147 lives were lost in 138 two-wheeler accidents, which is 28.65% of the total deaths.
In a report released in February 2020, the World Bank pointed out that Bangladesh needs to invest an estimated $7.8 billion over the next decade to halve its road crash fatalities.
The report attributed the high death rate on Bangladesh’s roads to lack of investments in systemic, targeted, and sustained road safety programmes.>";<409>;<D>;<Friday>;<at Saraigachchi>;<Saraigachchi>;<Rajshahi>;<Naogaon>;<Porsha>;<road>;<Bangladesh>;<road>;<2>;<0>;<ram>;<Truck>;<NA>;<NA>;<NA>;<(17, 22)>;<20210717 10:44>

The accidents took place from May 30 and June 9 on roads, highways, and inter-district and regional roads across the country, including the capital, said a report released by National Committee to Protect Shipping, Roads and Railways (NCPSRR) on Monday.
The NCPSRR’s Eid transport management observation and survey report was prepared based on news items published in online versions of several national and regional dailies, online news portals, news agencies and television channels, it said.
The report said the transport management on roads and waterways was comparatively better during this Eid than a few years ago.
Almost all the highways were free from gridlocks while there were enough launches in Dhaka to carry homebound people to coastal areas, it said.
According to the report, Eid holidaymakers were, however, deprived of desired services from the railway authorities for the schedule collapse of trains.
Besides, the authorities concerned failed to check exorbitant bus and launch fares charged from passengers, the NCPSRR said.
It said seven people were killed and eight others received injuries in seven accidents on May 30 while six killed and seven injured in six accidents on May 31.
On June 1, 10 people were killed and 31 others injured in 11 accidents. Fifteen accidents on June 2 left 27 people dead and 38 others injured. On June 3, at least 13 people embraced death and 14 others sustained injuries in seven accidents.
Sixteen people were killed and 62 others wounded in six road accidents on June 4,
26 killed and 78 injured in 16 accidents on June 5, the Eid day, 11 killed and 33 wounded in eight road crashes on June 6 and 11 killed and 18 others injured in six accidents on June 7.
Eight people lost their lives on roads and 11 others received injuries in seven accidents on June 8 while six accidents took place on June 9 when five were killed and 24 others injured.
Ashis Kumar Dey, general secretary of the NCPSRR, told UNB that they have identified six vital reasons for accidents during the Eid holydays.
The reasons include speedy driving to recoup time lost in several ferry ghats and toll stations, reckless driving on free roads, negligence by traffic policemen, drivers’ absent mindedness while driving vehicles for pressure from passengers to drop them to their destinations on time, physical and mental unfitness of drivers for making extra trips, tendency to violate traffic rules while overtaking and free movement of three-wheeled vehicles and motorbikes on highways and inter-district roads.>";<11>;<D>;<Sunday>;<by National Committee>;<Dhaka>;<Dhaka>;<Dhaka>;<NA>;<highway>;<Bangladesh>;<road>;<143>;<324>;<others>;<Bus>;<Launch>;<NA>;<NA>;<NA>;<20190610 19:30>

A total of 4,580 people were killed and 10,828 others injured in 4,317 road accidents in 2018 while 4,628 people lost their lives and 8,621 others suffered injuries in 4,219 accidents from January 1 to December 31 last year, according to a report of Shipping and Communication Reporters’ Forum (SCRF).
The report ‘Annual Road Accident Report 2019’ was prepared based on news published in 24 national dailies, 10 regional newspapers and nine online news portals and news agencies.
The accidents took place on highways, national highways and national, inter-district and regional roads.
The journalists’ platform identified some reasons for reduction in the number of road accidents across the country last year.
These include growing public awareness by publishing reports on road transportation on the media round the year, arranging different programmes against road accidents by different social organisations, road transport and bridges minister's active presence on roads, increased responsibility of police personnel and mobile courts against faulty vehicles and fake driving licences, identifying different risky turning points and establishing cautionary signs there and road repairs.

According to the report, 411 people, including 53 women and 71 children, lost their lives and 725 others received injuries in 383 accidents in January last year while around 401 accidents took place in February when 415 people were killed and 884 others injured. Of the deceased, 58 were women and 62 children.
In March, around 386 people, including 46 women and 82 children, were killed and 820 others injured in 384 road accidents and some 327 accidents took place in April that claimed the lives of 340 people and left 610 others injured. The deceased include 38 were women and 53 children.

In December, 446 people died and 681 others injured in 389 road crashes. Of the deceased, 47 were women and 57 children.
SCRF President Ashis Kumar Dey said the majority of the fatal road accidents took place due to whimsical driving and lack of carefulness of drivers of heavy vehicles like buses and trucks.
There was also lack of proper monitoring and supervision by authorities concerned in this regard, he added.
The SCRF observation also said an increase in the number of small and local mechanised vehicles on regional roads and inter-district roads and highways, extortion in several spots, including all bus and truck terminals, displeasure of transport workers and overall anarchy in the road transport sector were the other reasons behind road accidents.

A video clip containing the incident went viral on social media instantly.
The teenager was identified as Liza Akhter, 19, wife of Junayed Gazi of Bypass area in Akhaura upazila of the district.
Eyewitness Md Amzad Bhuiyan, who captured the video, said three people including Liza and her husband were walking on Titas Bridge and taking pictures of themselves, when a train came speeding.
Though Liza’s husband and another woman managed to get out of the way, Liza’s legs got trapped in the rail track as the Noakhali-bound ‘’Upakul Express’’ train from Dhaka was approaching.
Showing remarkable presence of mind, Liza stopped trying to get off and instead used her slender frame to lie flat on the track - although this too was risky.
“The train ran over Liza, leaving her slightly injured,” Amzad said.
Liza was rushed to the Upazila Health Complex where she received first aid.

Md Mazharul Islam, officer-in-charge of Akhaura railway police station, said that they were aware about the incident.>";<1>;<D>;<Friday>;<in Akhaura Bypass>;<Akhaura Bypass>;<Chittagong>;<Brahmanbaria>;<Akhaura>;<other>;<Bangladesh>;<train>;<0>;<0>;<others>;<Train>;<NA>;<NA>;<NA>;<(19)>;<20220723 01:50>

He was 78.
He breathed his last at 9:25 am at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University in the capital, his son Arnab Aditya Das confirmed to UNB over mobile phone.
Shib Narayan was born in Cumilla and his father was Satish Chandra Das who was captured and killed by the Pakistani army during the liberation war in 1971. Shib Narayan is now survived by his wife Gitashree Chowdhury and their son Arnab Das.
Shib Narayan joined politics following the language movement hero Dhirendranath Dutta. He participated in the education movement of 1962 and was imprisoned.
He was an activist and leader of Chhatra League. On June 7, 1970, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was scheduled to take part in a student parade held at Paltan Maidan in Dhaka. For this purpose, a squad of students was formed named as 'February-15 Force'. The student leaders decided to create a flag of this force.
On June 6, 1970, with this aim the then Chhatra League leaders ASM Abdur Rab, Shahjahan Siraj, Kazi Aref Ahmed and Marshal Monirul Islam sat in the room No-108 of Sergeant Zahurul Haque Hall of Dhaka University to discuss the flag plan.
Chhatra League leader Swapan Kumar Chowdhury, Jagannath College BCL leader Nazrul Islam, Cumilla district BCL general secretary and central student leader Shib Narayan Das, BUET BCL general secretary Hasanul Haq Inu and student leader Yusuf Salauddin were present in the meeting
At the end of the discussion based on the initial proposal of Kazi Aref, it was decided to make a flag with a yellow map of Bengal in the middle of the red sun on the green ground. Kamrul Alam Khan then stitched a red circle in the middle of a large piece of green cloth from a Bihari tailor's shop in Dhaka's New Market.
Then the map of East Pakistan was drawn on tracing paper with an atlas from Enamul Haque of room No-312 of Titumir Hall of the University of Engineering.
Shib Narayan Das finally drew the map with a skillful hand in the middle of the red circle. Later, at the instruction of Father of the Nation Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Patua Kamrul Hasan gave a new look to the national flag of Bangladesh.
In a condolence message, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal-JASD President Hasanul Haque Inu and General Secretary Shirin Akhtar expressed deep shock at the demise of the flag designer and conveyed sympathy to the bereaved family.>";<1>;<D>;<Friday>;<at the Intensive Care Unit>;<Bangladesh>;<Dhaka>;<Dhaka>;<NA>;<other>;<Bangladesh>;<road>;<0>;<0>;<others>;<NA>;<NA>;<NA>;<NA>;<NA>;<20240419 12:12>

Road accidents in Bangladesh
Road accidents are one of the leading causes of deaths in Bangladesh, as 37,170 people were killed in 26,902 accidents across the country in the past five years.
In January 2021 alone, as many as 484 people were killed and 673 injured in 427 road accidents across Bangladesh -- a  25.58% rise year-on-year, according to Road Safety Foundation (RSF).
At least 445 lives were lost in 340 road accidents in January last year, RSF said on Saturday.
WB Report on road safety
As per a World Bank report, published in February 2020, Bangladesh needs to invest an estimated extra $7.8 billion over the next decade to halve its road crash fatalities.
The report attributed the high death rate on Bangladesh roads to a chronic lack of investment in systemic, targeted, and sustained road safety programmes.
The annual road crash deaths per capita in Bangladesh are twice the average rate for high-income countries and five times that of the best-performing countries in the world, it said.
Children and the working-age population are most affected by road crash injuries in Bangladesh, the World Bank report added.

Road accidents in Bangladesh
Road accidents in Bangladesh continue to claim hundreds of lives every year.
At least 484 people were killed and 673 injured in 427 road accidents in January this year.
According to Road Safety Foundation (RSF) accident rates jumped by 25.58 percent and fatalities by 8.76 percent in January this year compared to the same period last year.
At least 445 lives were lost in 340 road accidents in January 2020, according to RSF.
In a report released in February 2020, the World Bank said that Bangladesh needed to invest an estimated extra $7.8 billion over the next decade to halve its road crash fatalities.
The report attributed the high death rate on Bangladesh’s roads to lack of investments in systemic, targeted, and sustained road safety programmes.

“The cases against them (BNP) are related to different crimes. They committed offenses. So, legal action is being taken against them,” she said.
The premier made these remarks while addressing an event arranged in Ganabhaban to exchange views with the central committee members of Bangladesh Krishak League on the occasion of its 52th founding anniversary.
She said the cases should be disposed of quickly to ensure punishment for these crimes.
The PM said the cases were filed for commitment of crimes like arson violence, killing people, corruption, arms smuggling and grenade attacks.
Noting that BNP unleashed arson violence in 2013 and 2014 in a bid to resist the 2014 general election, she said they burnt 3800 cars, buses, launches and trains.
Talking about the violence before the recently held 12th parliamentary election, Hasina said they committed the 28th October incident and killed a mother and her child by setting fire to trains to thwart the polls.
“Should not show cases be filed against those who committed these things? Would people worship them?” she said.
She said today they are raising the issue everywhere that cases are filed against them. They have to be asked what the cases were filed for, she added.
Turning down the claim that 60 lakh BNP leaders and workers are in jail, the prime minister said that the jails of the country have no capacity to accommodate so many people.
“They’re claiming that their 60 lakh men are arrested, but we (our jails) don't even have such capacity (to accommodate so many people),” she said.
The premier said if so many BNP men are detained in jails, it means all who are now in jails are their men and there are no other criminals anymore there. “It means all criminals there (who are in the jails) belong to BNP,” she said.
Depicting the horrific scenes of violence and torture on Awami League leaders and activists during the BNP regimes, the PM said her government didn’t go to take revenge, but instead devoted its merit and power to developing the country and working for its people.
“It is lucky for them that we are in power. They still can get scope to talk (raise voice) as we are not revengeful like them. They talk all day using the loud speaker and then they say they don't get scope to speak,” she said.
President of Bangladesh Krishak League Samir Chandra presided over the function.
Bangladesh Krishak League, an associate body of Bangladesh Awami League, was established on April 19, 1972.>";<1>;<D>;<Friday>;<in Ganabhaban>;<Ganabhaban>;<NA>;<NA>;<NA>;<other>;<Bangladesh>;<road>;<1>;<0>;<others>;<NA>;<NA>;<NA>;<NA>;<NA>;<20240419 15:03>

The deceased was identified as Tamjid, 6, son of Bashar Bepari and his cousin brother Tahsin, 5, son of Karim Bepari of the village.
Locals said Tahsin and Tamjid fell into the pond while playing on its bank near their house and drowned around noon – the very same pattern that is found behind the deaths of thousands of other minors in Bangladesh every year.
A 2017 study published in esteemed medical journal The Lancet said drowning accounts for an astonishing 43 percent of all deaths in the 1-4 age group in Bangladesh.
Unicef quotes a survey by the Centre for Injury Prevention and Research, Bangladesh (CIPRB) that says over 18,000 Bangladeshis aged 1-18 die of drowning each year – more than 50 each day.
Most of the deaths occur among unsupervised children between one and five years old in ponds that are very close to their homes. Seventy-five percent of drownings were found to happen within 65 feet of home. Sixty percent of the victims drown between 9am and 1pm, when older siblings are at school and mothers are preparing food, gathering wood and water, or tending to crops.
The pattern is present in the deaths of Tamjid and Tahsin too, whose bodies were eventually recovered by neighbours and taken to Shariatpur Sadar hospital where duty doctors declared them dead.
But their deaths hardly capture the nation’s attention as say road accidents or some diseases do, leading some experts to call it ‘a silent killer’.>";<1>;<D>;<Wednesday>;<in Bangladesh>;<Karim>;<NA>;<NA>;<NA>;<water>;<Bangladesh>;<road>;<1>;<0>;<others>;<NA>;<NA>;<NA>;<NA>;<(6, 5, 1)>;<20190417 23:32>

Road accidents in Bangladesh
Road accidents in Bangladesh continue to claim hundreds of lives every year.
At least 484 people were killed and 673 injured in 427 road accidents in January this year.

At least 445 lives were lost in 340 road accidents in January 2020, according to the RSF.
In a report released in February 2020, the World Bank said Bangladesh needs to invest an estimated extra $7.8 billion over the next decade to halve its road crash fatalities.
The report attributed the high death rate on Bangladesh’s roads to lack of investments in systemic, targeted, and sustained road safety programmes.>";<427>;<D>;<Sunday>;<in Madhukhali>;<Madhukhali>;<Dhaka>;<Faridpur>;<Madhukhali>;<highway>;<Bangladesh>;<road>;<8>;<10>;<hit>;<Car>;<Truck>;<Microbus>;<NA>;<NA>;<20210321 10:34>

However, Bangladesh’s lone representative to the investigation commission Salauddin M Rahmatullah said the report only blamed the pilot without mentioning the faults of the Air Traffic Control (ATC) of Tribhuvan International Airport.
The US-Bangla Airlines flight BS211 from Dhaka crashed on its second landing attempt at Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport on March 12, 2018, killing 51 people, including the pilot and co-pilot, and injuring 20 others.
The investigation report compiled by Nepalese officials and made available Monday said the probable cause of the crash was the pilot's disorientation and loss of situation awareness, reports AP.
The Nepalese investigation report said, ""Contributing to this, the aircraft was offset to the proper approach path that led to maneuvers in a very dangerous and unsafe altitude to alight with the runway. Landing was completed in a sheer desperation after sighting the runway, at very close proximity and very low altitude.”
It also said the pilot had been released from the Bangladesh Air Force in 1993 due to depression and was only allowed to fly civilian planes from 2002 after a detailed medical evaluation.
Also, the pilot was under stress and emotionally disturbed and had lack of sleep in the preceding night.
The report also cited a lack of assertiveness from controllers at Kathmandu airport in monitoring the flight path and failing to issue clear instructions to carry out a standard missed-approach procedure.
The flight crew and the controllers also lacked a clear understanding of each other when they communicated about the landing runway, the report said.
The report recommended that assertiveness in such situations become part of the training for air traffic controllers.
It also asked the Bangladesh civil aviation authority to reassess the physical and psychological status of grounded pilots before their licenses are renewed and that all airline pilots undergo psychological evaluation during training.
Salauddin, also Flight Operation Consultant of Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB), briefed reporters over the report in Dhaka on Monday.
He said, “The pilot missed the approach while landing the aircraft. Although the ATC could have assisted the pilot, they didn’t do so. Rather the ATC officials took shelter under the table when the plane crashed near the ATC tower.”
“When the pilot missed the approach, two pilots on ground requested the ATC to assist the pilot through the radar. But the ATC didn’t take any measure in this regard. Had the ATC assisted the pilot, the accident could have been averted,” the CAAB official said.
He said Bangladesh will put forward some proposals for incorporation in the report. “If the proposals are not included, Bangladesh will lodge complaint with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO),” he said.
CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal M Naim Hassan said the pilot somehow missed the approach, but it was the duty of the ATC to assist him. “They (ATC officials) didn’t do so.”>";<1>;<D>;<Monday>;<in Nepal>;<US>;<Dhaka>;<Dhaka>;<NA>;<other>;<Bangladesh>;<road>;<2018>;<1>;<others>;<NA>;<NA>;<NA>;<NA>;<NA>;<20190128 22:03>

Road accidents in Bangladesh
Road accidents claim hundreds of lives every year in Bangladesh.
In January this year, at least 484 people were killed in 427 road crashes.
According to Road Safety Foundation (RSF), accident rates jumped by 25.58 percent and fatalities by 8.76 percent in January compared to the same period last year.
At least 445 lives were lost in 340 road accidents in January 2020, according to RSF.
Besides, a total of 409 pedestrians, including 66 women and 97 children, were killed between January and March this year in road accidents, according to the Road Safety Foundation (RSF), which was published in April 12.
A report prepared by RSF with information collected from seven national dailies, five online portals and electronic media reports, blamed 61.8 percent of the accidents on reckless driving and 38.19 percent on the insincerity of pedestrians.
In a report released in February 2020, the World Bank said that Bangladesh needs to invest an estimated extra $7.8 billion over the next decade to halve its road crash fatalities.
The report attributed the high death rate on Bangladesh’s roads to a lack of investments in systemic, targeted, and sustained road safety programmes.>";<340>;<D>;<Sunday>;<on Sylhet>;<Jointapur>;<NA>;<NA>;<NA>;<highway>;<Bangladesh>;<road>;<5>;<2>;<ram>;<CNG>;<Truck>;<Rickshaw>;<NA>;<(35, 35, 7, 33, 50, 40)>;<20210502 12:00>

Assistant Sub-Inspector Billal Hossain of the Karnaphuli Police Station, under the Chattogram Metropolitan Police, reported that the chain-reaction collision was initiated by a private car that lost control due to excessive speed.

In the aftermath of the collision, authorities seized all vehicles involved as part of their ongoing investigation into the incident. This accident adds to a troubling pattern of similar occurrences within the Bangabandhu Tunnel, which has seen seven to eight accidents in the mere four months following its inauguration on October 28 last year.
The situation has been further complicated by a video that surfaced online, showcasing illegal car racing inside the tunnel immediately after its opening. The viral footage prompted legal action, with a case filed on November 1 against the individuals involved, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced safety measures and stricter enforcement of traffic regulations within this crucial infrastructure.>";<1>;<D>;<NA>;<Bangabandhu Tunnel in Chattogram>;<Chattogram>;<NA>;<NA>;<NA>;<other>;<Bangladesh>;<road>;<0>;<5>;<collision>;<Car>;<NA>;<NA>;<NA>;<NA>;<20240211 09:49>
